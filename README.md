> The main Pown.js package distribution.

## Quickstart

From the same directory as your project's package.json, install this module with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install pown-dist --save
```

Once that's done, utilise the modules though [pown-cli](https://github.com/pownjs/pown-cli) and [pown](https://github.com/pownjs/pown).

```sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/pown
```
